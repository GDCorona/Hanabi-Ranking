The main difference is her sparkling star eyes which I think are more splendid than Yusa's, but the art in Charlotte is just way more iconic for me.", "VA: Igoma Yurie <br> Ruby's voice is really chill and it brings me a delightful vibe. It's just that she doesn't have as many special moments to express her voice at different types of emotion like the above characters. Her position will probably change when the next season come out and she will have more screentime."],

I personally don't really like much about her personality, as she often being indifferent and barely show her feelings. However I still admire Ai since her role demand her to be more mature than her ages and she has done an excellent job in supporting Kaguya a lot in her life and became one of the few persons she can trust and be honest with.", "VA: Hanamori Yumiri <br> Hayasaka mainly shows off in her maid outfit and that's when I see her most captivating. At school her style is more bright and reflect a young energetic schoolgirl. There was also a special ocassion when she turned on \"naive Hayasaka\" mode and dressed in a totally different way, that's when she tried to seduce Shirogane but failed, and I also found that style very charming!", "VA: Hanamori Yumiri <br> Her voice doesn't sound that remarkable for me as it sounds lethargic and pretty much like a robot. However it's understandable since she must be very tired dealing with troubles from Kaguya (mainly about her love struggle with president). She does sometimes sounds more lively though...that's often when she is at school and during these times she has left us the 2 legendary words which is \"Heyyy Heyyyyyyyyyy!!!!\"."],

Initially Shirogane is the only person that she actually really care about but as the anime progressed we are able to see more about her good side as she began to open herself more and had more good relationships. Thanks to that, I could understand her better and have more feelings for her even though she is not the type of girls I like.", "VA: Koga Aoi <br> Kaguya is an opulent lady who has the charm and charisma of an aristocat. However just like Chika I am interested more about her funny moments as she expressed a lot of cute \"meme\" faces, while her overall appearance is still overshadowed by many characters in other animes. I think it's partly because Love is war isn't too striking in terms of art and there are a lot of animes such as Fate/ Stay Night, Charlotte and Date A Live just do a better job than that.", "VA: Koga Aoi <br> Do I need to say anything here? Her voice is one of the most precious treasure that God can gift to human beings. Although I love Secretary Fujiwara's voice a bit more, those 2 both made me die in cuteness. Kudos to Koga-san and Kohara-san for having such sweet voices that completely melted my heart!!! ~~"],
