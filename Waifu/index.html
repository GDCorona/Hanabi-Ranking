She began dating Tomoya after that event and eventually married him. Nagisa has a shy nature and never wants anyone to be hurt, that just make her an ideal girl for me and I love and cherish her just as much as Shouko. It was so shocking and heart-wrenching to see her passed away after giving birth to her daughter Ushio, fortunately the author still has mercy and let her survive in the true ending which is shown in the anime.
